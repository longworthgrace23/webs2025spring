                <p>I took these photos on a Nikon D500 for The Pitt News. They were edited in Adobe Lightroom and mark my first professional-level photography assignment. See some of my personal work on Instagram, which is linked at the bottom of this website's home page.</p>

                <p>This piece was composed in Audacity for a class called "Composing Digital Media." Navigate to the .mp3 file listed on the linked repository's menu to hear to this audio narrative, which walks the listener through a stressful day in the narrator's life.</p>

                <p>Linked above is a repository containing my second project composed for "Composing Digital Media." It was created using GIMP and warns against ignoring the warnings provided by history by drawing a connection between today's America and 1930s Germany.</p>
