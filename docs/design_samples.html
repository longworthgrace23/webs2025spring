            <p>I have both academic and professional experience in visual and digital media projects. See the links below to learn more about the work I've done in these areas:</p>

                        <p>I took these photos on a Nikon D500 for The Pitt News. They were edited in Adobe Lightroom and mark my first professional-level photography assignment. See some of my personal work on Instagram, which is linked at the bottom of this website's home page.</p>

                        <p>This piece was composed in Audacity for a class called "Composing Digital Media." Navigate to the .mp3 file listed on the linked repository's menu to hear to this audio narrative, which walks the listener through a stressful day in the narrator's life.</p>

                        <p>Linked above is a repository containing my second project composed for "Composing Digital Media," viewable under the listed .png file. It was created using GIMP and warns against ignoring the warnings provided by history by drawing a connection between today's America and 1930s Germany.</p>
