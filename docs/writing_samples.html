                <h2>The Pitt News</h2>
                <p>As an editor at The Pitt News, I've had the opportunity to contribute to desks outside of my own. My pieces range in focus from global current events and national politics to the untold stories of outstanding Pitt students. Here are some notes on my favorites:</p>

                            <h3>TPN Opinions Column | Billionaires Don't Belong in Newsrooms</h3>
                            <p>I wrote this column in response to the Washington Post's refusal to endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election. It dives into the conflicts of interest that plague billionaire Jeff Bezos' ownership of the Post and the responsibilities large media corporations have to their readers.

                            <h3>TPN Opinions Column | Why Can't Ariana Grande be a Musical Theater Powerhouse and a Pop Star?</h3>
                            <p>This column explores the undue criticism faced by female celebrities who step outside their domain of success, and why Ariana Grande's career is a testament to still-powerful double standards successful, public-facing women are burdened by.

                            <h3>TPN "Silhouettes" Feature | Ian Labatch: A Panther Pitt Leader and Icon 'Bathed in Blue and Gold'</h3>
                            <p>This story is a feature on Ian Labatch, one of the leaders of Pitt's football student section who is recognizable in a rather unorthodox way. It was written for TPN's end-of-year "Silhouettes" special edition and was my first foray into personal reporting. Read my story on Ian at the link above.</p>
