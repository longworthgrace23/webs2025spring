    <h1>An Analysis: Abortion as a Voting Issue</h1>
    <p class="byline">By Grace Longworth, Katelyn Pisani, Madeline Campbell, Mia Flaherty, Shannon Seidel and Kayal Sadasivam</p>
    <p class="context">Conducted for Professor Angie Ocampo-Roland's fall 2024 "Political Attitudes and Public Opinion" course. Edited for length, focusing on my contributions and necessary context.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Abortion remains one of the most contentious topics in American politics, significantly influencing decision-making at the ballot box. Its role in shaping voter behavior was especially significant leading up to the recent 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the legality and accessibility of abortion services became a central issue in national debates. With this context in mind, understanding how voters’ views on abortion influenced their candidate preferences in the 2024 election can offer valuable insights into the shifting political landscape. Moreover, it is crucial to explore how demographic factors, such as gender and religious beliefs, played a role in how voters approached the abortion issue when choosing their presidential candidate.</p>
    <p>To investigate these dynamics, we surveyed voters on how abortion shaped their decisions in the 2024 election. Specifically, we sought to answer three key research questions: How did voters’ opinions on abortion shape their candidate preferences in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election? Were women more likely than men to prioritize abortion in their voting decisions? And how did religious views impact the importance of abortion in shaping electoral choices? By examining these questions, this study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the role abortion played in the election and how social, cultural, and religious factors intersected with political behavior in this pivotal election year.</p>
    <h2>Literature Review</h2>
    <p>Previous literature demonstrates that opinions about abortion influence political decisions. In addition, gender identity and religious beliefs shape views on abortion, which in turn influences candidate preference in presidential elections. This prompts further investigation into these variables that influence voter behavior. Among voters in general, abortion attitudes coincide with candidate preference on both the pro-choice and pro-life sides of the issue. Studies find that individuals who identify as pro-choice overwhelmingly align with Democratic candidates, while those who are pro-life are more likely to support Republican candidates, indicating a clear partisan divide based on abortion stance (Ansolabehere & Iyengar, 1996). Further, in 2024, Gallup found in their annual Values and Beliefs poll that the portion of voters who would only cast their vote for a candidate sharing their views on abortion hit 32% – a record high, up eight points from the last presidential election (Brenan & Saad, 2024). This shift coincides with the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which could explain voters’ dramatic, newfound passion. Now that Roe does not offer the protections and security pro-choice voters once enjoyed, concern over the issue has grown. These voters are more likely to take their abortion views into voting consideration now than ever before.</p>
    <p>Evangelical voters are also more heavily motivated by abortion views than other religious groups. One study conducted after the 2020 election found that white Evangelicals voted for the pro-life presidential candidate in an overwhelming majority, 80% for Trump and 15% for Biden (Campbell et al., 2020). The same metric found that individuals who attended church more frequently were more likely to support Trump. Highly religious candidates tend to attract more support from highly religious people, but also from conservatives and members of the Republican party due to opinions about issues like abortion (Castle et al., 2017). The influence of religion on abortion opinion reveals that religiosity is connected to abortion views, and such views can impact candidate preference in presidential elections. </p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>The methodology for the Collaborative Pennsylvania Exit Poll 2024 was designed and conducted by the University of Pittsburgh’s Political Attitudes and Public Opinion course members. The survey intended to gather insights into voters’ preferences, priorities, and perceptions. This voluntary, anonymous survey was administered to voters immediately after they cast their ballots at polling stations across various neighborhoods in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Students from the course collaborated to design a set of questions that would capture a wide range of demographic factors, political preferences, and issue priorities influencing voter behavior. Six major political issues were explored, including immigration, climate change, prison reform, foreign policy/national security, the economy/inflation, and reproductive rights. The survey ensured confidentiality and encouraged honest participation by not requiring any personal identification from respondents. Participation was voluntary, and respondents could skip any question they found uncomfortable or sensitive.</p>
    <p>A key component of the survey was its focus on reproductive rights, with a particular emphasis on respondents’ views on abortion. The first question concerning abortion was: "How important was the issue of abortion to you when choosing which Presidential candidate to vote for?” with options ranging from “very important” to “not important at all.” The second survey question regarding abortion was: “Do you believe abortion should be legal under…” with options ranging from “all circumstances” to “no circumstances.” To facilitate our analysis, we operationalized the terms pro-choice and pro-life. Pro-choice respondents are those who selected that abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances, reflecting support for abortion rights in a wide range of cases. Pro-life respondents are those who selected that abortion should be legal in few or no circumstances, indicating opposition to abortion except in limited circumstances or complete opposition.</p>
    <p>By combining responses to these key questions with demographic data such as gender, age, religion, and education, the survey provided a nuanced understanding of how abortion views intersected with other political attitudes. This operationalization of pro-choice and pro-life positions, along with the focus on abortion's importance in candidate selection, enabled a comprehensive analysis of how reproductive rights influenced voting behavior in the 2024 Presidential election.</p>
    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <img class="table" src="img\research_table.png" alt="A statistical table generated in Excel displaying respondent's views on abortion by religion.">
    <p>This analysis shows clear differences between categories of the independent variable, the respondent’s religion, and those differences impact on the dependent variable, the respondent’s abortion views. It reveals a strong relationship between denominations of Christianity and opposition to abortion. Our hypothesis looked specifically at pro-life attitudes among Catholics, and it was incorrect. While the data shows Catholics as having greater pro-life tendencies than some other religious groups, it does not suggest that they are more likely than other, non-Catholic denominations to disagree with abortion in all or most circumstances. Rather, our data shows Evangelical Protestants making up the only majority pro-life religious group at 73.34%. This figure is staggering since no other group surveyed reached above even a 50% threshold for pro-life attitudes; only 42.37% of Catholic respondents reported believing that abortion should be legal in few or no circumstances. Furthermore, just 4.03% of total survey respondents and 1.69% of Catholics answered that abortion should be legal under “no circumstances.” In stark contrast, 26.67% of Evangelicals gave that same answer. Based on these figures, the data suggests not just strong pro-life attitudes among Evangelical Christians but stronger convictions in those attitudes than other religious groups.</p>
