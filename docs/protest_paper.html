        <h1>Free Speech on College Campuses: The Decline of Discourse and Dialogue</h1>
        <p class="byline">By Grace Longworth</p>
        <p class="context">Written for Professor Margaret Saigh's fall 2024 "Writing for the Public" course</p>
            <p>The University of Pittsburgh is entering its second “Year of Discourse and Dialogue.” According to the Office of the Provost, the University chose to extend the theme from our previous academic year into this one in order to “remain true to our commitments to civic discourse, freedom of expression, and critical inquiry.” College campuses have historically served as respected grounds for academic and political discourse. Young people occupying these spaces are expected and encouraged to develop into civic-minded individuals through expressions of free speech and protest. In recent decades, however, student protesters have increasingly been met with hindrance and discouragement handed down from their institutions and the authoritative forces at their disposal. Pitt serves as a prime example of this shift from the encouragement to the extinguishing of free speech on college campuses as evidenced by its handling of student protests in the past and present.</p>
            <p>On October 15, 1969, students and faculty on the Cathedral lawn participated in what was then the largest political protest in Pittsburgh’s history, the Vietnam Moratorium. Protesters chanted, marched, gave speeches, and planted 135 white crosses near Heinz Memorial Chapel, one for each Pittsburgher who had died in the war (Barilar). The protest was city-wide, and other renditions of it took place on nearby campuses. Pitt’s was the largest and longest by far, lasting the entire day. The Vietnam Moratorium was vocally supported by the University – namely, by Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar. In the days following the protest, Chancellor Posvar gave statements to a reporter from The Pitt News, the University’s independent student newspaper, regarding his dedication to upholding the students’ right to free speech and expression. He committed himself to respecting the protest and ensuring that his decisions for the University’s operation did not interfere with it. He noted that “‘[p]eople cannot boycott classes that are not being held,’” citing this as a reason he would refuse to implement a mandatory shutdown of University functions in response to the moratorium (Joyce). Posvar further expressed his sincere belief that “‘a university must respect the points of view of even the smallest minority on its campus and provide for expressions of individual opinion’” (Joyce). The most key facet of Chancellor Posvar’s words is that they were not just words. They were reinforced by his actions – the protest was permitted to continue until its natural end. Pitt students and faculty were supported in their efforts to be heard thanks to their institution’s leadership and its respect for their voices.</p>
            <p>The same cannot be said in 2024. As recently as June of this year, students and faculty members on college campuses across the country and the world, including here at Pitt, participated in encampment-style protests denouncing the Israeli government for its occupation and bombing campaign in Palestine. Pitt’s specific protest involved setting up tents strewn with banners and flags on campus green spaces, marching and chanting, and hosting speeches by student and community leaders against the war in Gaza. These events are largely similar to the protests staged in 1969 with a key difference being that the 2024 protesters intended to stay longer than a day because they had specific demands of the University and Chancellor Joan Gabel. </p>
            <p>Unlike the anti-war protests of 1969, the encampments on Pitt’s campus were not regarded as expressions of political discourse deserving of respect. Rather, Chancellor Gabel described them as “unsettling” in her June 3rd statement addressing the protest. In her university-wide message, Gabel appeared to echo Chancellor Posvar’s words from 55 years prior. She reiterated a commitment to free expression and assured the campus community that “the University of Pittsburgh is grounded in the spirit of discourse and dialogue” (Gabel). Gabel’s words, unlike Posvar’s, were hollow in that her actions from the start of the movement to the present disprove them.</p>
            <p>One of the protesters’ (still unmet) demands is a meeting with Gabel to discuss Pitt’s investments in Israeli companies. In her statement, Gabel made unsubstantiated claims that the leaders making these requests were “not affiliated with the University in any capacity” in an attempt to justify her refusal. Following the statement’s release, the organizers confirmed their status as Pitt students and their affiliation with the registered student organization Students for Justice in Palestine (@sjp_pitt, letter response). The organization has continued to demand a meeting in the forms of email requests, social media posts, and further protesting. Just this week, Pitt students interrupted Gabel’s remarks at a University event in Alumni Hall, publicly accusing her of continuing to “ignore the students calling for divestment.” In an Instagram post about the disruption, they stated that they have not heard from her in 52 days (@pittapartheiddivest). Gabel’s commitment to upholding the spirit of discourse and dialogue on her campus would be more substantiated if she showed a willingness to engage in a dialogue with students herself.            </p>
            <p>It is worth acknowledging that the presence of police and security officials were felt at both the 1969 and 2024 Pitt protests. There is no doubt that protests have always been heavily policed, not just on Pitt’s campus but across the United States. The shift in ideology has largely taken place among the heads of colleges and universities that hold the power to request police intervention in silencing students during times of political discourse. These types of actions or inactions, and the peaceful or aggressive behavior of the cops they call upon, reflect a school’s attitude towards free speech on campus.             </p>
            <p>Recorded accounts in The Pitt News show that in October 1969, police and students had unsavory interactions during protests, but students at Pitt’s Vietnam Moratorium were not inhibited from carrying out their planned events (Ging). Police made no effort to terminate the protest before it came to its natural conclusion. In June 2024, police made attempts to force dispersal by forming a human barricade around the Gaza Solidarity encampment. They physically prevented people and supplies from reaching the protesters inside, resulting in the escalations that were seen (@sjp_pitt, encampment footage). The differences in police handling of student protesters in 2024 compared to 1969 are incredibly clear and even more jarring.</p>
            <p>Based on changes in university and police behaviors, it can be reasonably speculated that the shift toward superficial endorsement of true freedom of speech by university administrators can be attributed to the Kent State Massacre of 1970. Students at the Ohio institution had been, initially peacefully, protesting the U.S. invasion of Cambodia for days prior to the tragedy. Confrontations between protesters and police turned violent, and Kent’s mayor requested that the governor send in the state’s National Guard. It was this force that fired into a crowd of protesters after ordering them to disperse, killing four students and wounding nine others (Kelly). In the wake of this tragic event, it is possible that schools may now deem it more acceptable to support protesters on the surface to stay in line with the First Amendment, but forcefully cut them short to avoid the risk of reaching such a state of tension that harm might befall their students. In the eyes of a university, a palatable protest that carries no risk of escalation is preferred. If that means intimidating students into limiting their expression to sitting quietly on a lawn, then that is what they must do. When nothing has been accomplished, no one has gotten hurt.             </p>
