### First Draft

This repository houses Grace Longworth's professional portfolio, built in HTML and CSS and designed for Professor Ben Miller's "Composing Digital Media" course at the University of Pittsburgh. 

This site walks the viewer through two main categories of my work: written and designed. The landing page also includes a brief introduction to me, an image of me, more in-depth information on my professional experience and skills, and links to my social media accounts. The site's two primary subpages divide the work samples I've chosen to include into the aforementioned categories and provide links to each one using related images.

### Preview

So far, the .html content of my web design project builds out the basic structure of the landing page. It includes a heading with a title and a navigation menu, space for a professional headshot and introduction, a projects section with further navigation to two undeveloped html pages, and a section that will contain information about my professional experience. Next steps for this page include writing up text to fill the space currently taken by placeholders, building up the styling, and increasing the functionality of the header's navigation. For the two blank pages linked in the 'projects' section menu, I plan to use them as a hub that direct users to links/further pages within the site containing my work samples. The samples included will correspond with the two subpages I have outlined.

### Proposal

My plan for this web design project is to curate a professional portfolio of my work in both journalistic/research writing and digital production/design (photojournalism, work from this class and similar projects, etc). The main pages within this project will be a home/landing page that gives a brief description of me and serves as a cover letter of sorts, a page each for writing samples and digital projects, and an “about” page that provides a more in-depth look at my professional experience (more like a resume). Since many of the samples I plan to include are unpublished and only exist in my Google Drive, the links to them in the greater writing samples/digital projects pages will lead to subpages within the website with text copied and pasted rather than external files. This will allow me greater freedom in their design (fonts, colors, etc) and avoid forcing users to download additional files to view the site’s contents. Any published work will include a link to its original publication.
