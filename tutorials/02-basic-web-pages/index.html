            <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
                <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.</p>
                <p>Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing">traditional climbing,</a> bouldering focuses on <strong>short but intensive routes</strong> called <em>"problems,"</em> typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</p>
                <p>Experience the perfect blend of physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving as you navigate routes close to the ground, with nothing but a crash pad and determination. Bouldering <strong>strips climbing down to its purest form,</strong> making it both accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts.</p>
