This repository houses Grace Longworth's professional portfolio, built in HTML and CSS and designed for Professor Ben Miller's "Composing Digital Media" course at the University of Pittsburgh. 

This site walks the viewer through two main categories of my work: written and designed. The landing page also includes a brief introduction to me, an image of me, more in-depth information on my professional experience and skills, and links to my social media accounts. The site's two primary subpages divide the work samples I've chosen to include into the aforementioned categories and provide links to each one using related images.
